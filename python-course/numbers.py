print(num)

# we can convert the numbers into strings
print(str(num) + " is a number") # this will print the number as a string

# the strings and numbers can be concactenated thats why we convert number into string by add str with the number

print(pow(3, 2)) # this will give us 3 to the power of 2, equals 9
print(max(10, 6)) # this will give us the maximum number between 10 and 6
print(min(10, 6)) # this will give us the minimum number between 10 and 6
print(round(3.2)) # this will round the number to the nearest integer
