# tupils are similar to lists, but they are immutable
# tupils are used to store multiple values in a single variable

coordinates = (4, 5) # this is a tuple with two values
# tupils are defined by using parentheses instead of square brackets
print(coordinates) # this will print the coordinates
# print the first value of the coordinates tuple
print(coordinates[0]) # this will print the first value of the coordinates tuple
